    "\n",
    "#### Why use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keeps your home space clean and manageable.\n",
    "- Different environments can be defined for different projects or analysis workflows \n",
    "\n",
    "    - e.g., Project 1 requires NumPy  v1.10 but Project 2 has a dependency that needs NumPy v1.9)\n",
